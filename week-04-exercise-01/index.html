        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>What text did you edit?</li>
            <p>I edited the header of the main apple.com page and the webpage buttons of the iPhone 17.</p>
            <li>What CSS properties did you modify?</li>
            <p>I changed the button colors and button font size of the iPhone 17.</p>
            <li>What made your edits interesting or amusing?</li>
            <p>I made a joke about the price gouging of the newest iPhones.</p>
            <li>Did you understand why some changes worked and some didn't?</li>
            <p>It took some tries to understand why some changes worked and others didn't, but in the end I was able to deduce what can and cannot be changed.</p>
            <li>Why did you choose the changes you did?</li>
            <p>I wanted my changes to be noticable, funny and obvious. I made the button text small so you can take a closer look and see the hidden joke.</p>
            <li>Were you able to understand how the HTML and CSS worked together to make the changes you made?</li>
            <p>Yes, this exercise helped me understand further how HTML and CSS work hand in hand for webpages.</p>
            <li>Do you think you have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting your own webpages?</li>
            <p>Yes! DevTools can seem overwhelming but with some practice... and vandalism... I was able to comprehend it some more.</p>
        </ul>
