                    The song "Smoke Signals" is a love song where the singer sings about someone sending smoke signals to catch her attention. In the song she writes about childhood nostalgia, a desire for connection and the complexities of a relationship. She ends the song with "You are anonymous, I am a concrete wall," which captures the tension between emotional barriers and a yearning for connection. As someone who struggles with letting others in, I resonate with this song.

                    "Rockland" is a heartbreak song is about regret, longing and the aftermath of a relationship. The singer is introspective and expresses regret, which I can relate to as someone who's mishandled love. My favorite part of this song is the chorus, where she sings "Bet you wish you, Never even met me, I can't blame you, Broke your every heartbeat."

                    Another love song where the singer sings about a past relationship from long ago. In the song the singer sees encounters his past lover in the rain and notices his ex had changes their appearance but kept their essence. The song acknowledges change and cherishes the memories they once shared, but doesn't yearn for reconnection like Rockland does. The song is named "Hobbes" after a cat who the lover in question had adopted in the years the two had not seen each other. I relate to this song, but feels more personal to me especially because I have a cat as well.

                    This song is another heartbreak song, where the singer sings about misfortune, disappointment, growth and reflection. The person they address in the song seems to be doing well and winning at life, whereas the singer feels they're at the "end of the world". The song has themes of gratitude, but also yearning. My favorite line from this song is "I'm grateful to you for letting me lose, and it's a damn shame you're good at winning." As someone who's felt like the loser of a breakup, this song definitely hits in the feels.

                <p class="description">
                    While most of my favorite music comes from the 2000s, this one is from the early 90s. The final song in The Sundays album, "Blind", this song explores devoted love and sacrifice. In the song The Sundays sing about their devotion to their love, and how "Wild horses couldn't drag me away". Beautiful song that inspires me that true love does exist.

                <p class="description">
                    My top and favorite song. This song is melanchonic, beautiful, and went viral in 2023 for it's lyrics. The song explores commitment in struggling relationships described as "losing dogs", a reference to how dogs are cruelly used in dogfight pits. In the song Mitski sings about how she commits herself to these relationships of these perceived underdogs. There's a sense of sympathy for the underdog where the singer pleas in her repeated lyrics "My baby". At the end of the song, Mitski acknowledges she is self-sabotaging herself by devoted herself to broken people aka "losing dogs" in the line "I always want you when I'm finally fine." This song is beautiful, complex, and an irony for a longing for a relation that you know will hurt you eventually. As someone who struggles with self sabotage, I relate to this song deeply.
